##PERSONAL STATEMENT

My mission is to seek collaborative solutions to scientific and societal issues, addressing my vision of applying science and technology to the betterment of human health. Among my long-term goals is the advancement of knowledge in functional genomics: the phenotypic and functional expression of the information contained within genomes.

In pursuit of this objective – building on a thorough grounding in biochemistry and molecular genetics – in recent years my scientific and intellectual interests have actively expanded to include informatics and computational methods. The intersection of these domains (genomics; programming; relational data; ...) enables a better understanding of functional and conceptual interactions, naturally leading to translational knowledge discovery that transcends dogmatic boundaries.
