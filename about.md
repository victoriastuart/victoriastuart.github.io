## Introduction

My mission is to seek collaborative solutions to scientific and societal issues, addressing my vision of applying science and technology to the betterment of human health. Among my long-term goals is the advancement of knowledge in functional genomics: the phenotypic and functional expression of the information contained within genomes.

In pursuit of this objective – building on a thorough grounding in biochemistry and molecular genetics – in recent years my scientific and intellectual interests have actively expanded to include informatics and computational methods. The intersection of these domains (genomics; programming; relational data; ...) enables a better understanding of functional and conceptual interactions, naturally leading to translational knowledge discovery that transcends dogmatic boundaries.

##Scientific Interests

While I focus on genomics and genetics, my scientific interests include artificial intelligence, biology, biochemistry, bioinformatics, cancer, cellular signaling, diet, DNA metabolism, graphical models, health, knowledge stores, mathematics, metabolism, microbiology, molecular genetics, machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), networks (interactions; relational data), neuroscience, 'omics (all), physics, programming, statistics/probabilistic models, synthetic biology, ...

My most recent (Jan 2014 - present) work predominantly revolves around:

### Genetics/Genomics:
  * functional genomics
  * molecular genetics
  * oncogenomics
  * pathways / networks

### Artificial Intelligence:
* clustering
* dimensionality
* machine learning
* NLP (natural language processing),<br>including annotation (biomedical corpora)

### Knowledge-Related:
* metadata
* graphical models
* RDF (resource description framework):triples / triplestores;<br>predicate structures (e.g. PAS: predicate argument structures)
* relational data
* heterogeneity

### ... More to come  :-) ...
